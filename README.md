This program was done individually by me without any teammates, and it's a 
ATM machine that has 6 features:
1. Check for balance
2. Withdraw money
3. Deposit money
4. Check your bank account information
5. Change your PIN
6. Exit the ATM machine

When the program is ran, the ATM machine ask you to enter your card number as well
as your PIN and it starts the program by showing the options of the program.

The program contains Getters and setters method, toString() method as well as .equals()
and I used different loops such as switch, while and if loops.
